## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a senior developer with a strong focus on building high-performance web applications and systems using Rust and WebAssembly. This repository serves as a hub for my personal projects, open-source contributions, and experiments at the intersection of systems programming and modern web technologies.

Rust has become my language of choice for its safety, speed, and expressive syntax. I use it to build applications that demand performance, reliability, and control over system resources. Whether itâ€™s backend services, CLI tools, or low-level components, I enjoy leveraging Rust's strengths to create efficient and maintainable codebases.

My work with WebAssembly extends these capabilities to the browser, enabling me to deliver near-native performance for web applications. By compiling Rust to WebAssembly, Iâ€™ve been able to push the boundaries of what's possible in the frontendâ€”developing applications that are fast, secure, and portable across platforms. Iâ€™m particularly interested in optimizing load times, memory usage, and runtime efficiency in client-side apps.

This repository includes a variety of projects, from full-stack web apps and custom WASM modules to Rust libraries and tooling utilities. Each one reflects a focus on performance, clean architecture, and thoughtful engineering practices.

Beyond code, Iâ€™m passionate about writing maintainable documentation, improving developer experience, and staying engaged with the open-source community. I see this space as both a portfolio and a platform for ongoing learning and collaboration.

Feel free to explore the projects, share feedback, or contribute. Iâ€™m always open to discussions around Rust, WebAssembly, and performance-oriented development.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity or supports your own development journey.
